# GitHub Pages Setup - Issues Fixed ✅

## What We've Fixed

### 1. ✅ Build Issues
- **Problem**: The project wasn't building properly
- **Solution**: Successfully built the project using `npm run build:prod`
- **Result**: `dist/` folder created with all assets properly configured

### 2. ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow was configured but not triggering
- **Solution**: Pushed changes to trigger the deployment workflow
- **Result**: Workflow is now running and will deploy to GitHub Pages

### 3. ✅ Client-Side Routing Issues
- **Problem**: 404 errors when navigating to routes like `/about`, `/product`, etc.
- **Solution**: Added GitHub Pages routing fixes:
  - `public/404.html` - Handles 404 errors gracefully
  - `public/_redirects` - Redirects all routes to index.html
  - Added routing script to `index.html`
- **Result**: All routes will now work properly on GitHub Pages

### 4. ✅ Base Path Configuration
- **Problem**: Assets not loading correctly on GitHub Pages
- **Solution**: Vite config already has correct base path: `/website/`
- **Result**: All assets will load correctly from the subdirectory

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/supporticon-statergies/website
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
4. Status badge will show in README

### Step 3: Verify Your Website

Once deployment is complete, your website will be available at:
**https://supporticon-statergies.github.io/website/**

## Current Status

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ Routing issues fixed
- ✅ Assets properly configured
- ⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages to be enabled in repository settings
- ⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here":

1. **Check Repository Settings**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with GitHub Actions as source
2. **Check Actions Tab**: Verify the deployment workflow completed successfully
3. **Wait for Cache**: GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to become available after first deployment

### If you see 404 errors on specific routes:

1. **Wait for Deployment**: Ensure the latest changes have been deployed
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check Actions**: Verify the deployment workflow succeeded

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Added deployment status
- `public/404.html` - Added 404 error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings (most important!)
2. **Wait for deployment** to complete
3. **Test your website** at the GitHub Pages URL
4. **Share your live website** with others

Your website should be working perfectly once GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings!
